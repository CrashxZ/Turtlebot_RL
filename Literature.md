The P2S scheme uses time-based and distance based  The on-demand technique is highly efficient while it takes advantage of the wireless charging vehicle’s (WCV) proximity to charge some of the not-so-urgent nodes. Such a combined method reduces the number of urgent charging requests in the future and thus improves WCV’s efficiency, charging throughput, and charging rate. This however dosent tackle the hetrogenious discharge rate of the sensors.
